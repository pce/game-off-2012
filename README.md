## CloneSheepCatcher

I had the entire month of November to create a **web-based** game *loosely* built around one or more of the following themes:

* forking (or forks)
* branching (or branches)
* cloning (or clones)
* pushing
* pulling

## Mission

You have to catch sheep clones to get `huddy` fall into a deep sleep.

## About

I used a selfwritten, stupid and simple [Pixmap Editor (github version gets updated, soon)](http://pce.github.com/html5/pixmap.html) to create most of the graphics and:

* gimp   - toolkit to polish the graphics 
* gamejs - framework
